# Pyber Analysis 
Analyzing Ridesharing data with Matplotlib and python.
## Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis was to gain insight on Pyber ride sharing data and find conclusions and trends in fare metrics. During this analysis we were able to filter the data through each city type that Pyber operated in and through these city types come to trends involving the average fare and average driver count and take away key summaries that involved this data. From this analysis we then created visualizations of the conclusions we found and therefore were able to understand the data more clearly and therefore help Pyber improve their ride-sharing services. 
## Analysis 
Analyzing the data from the two csv files we were given we were able to create an overview summary of Pyber ride-sharing data for each city type and show the metrics for each city type.
